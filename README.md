# Zero to Pandas: COVID-19 Vaccination Data Analysis in India 🇮🇳📊

This repository contains my course project for the **[Zero to Pandas](https://zerotopandas.com)** certification, where I performed an exploratory data analysis on COVID-19 vaccination data in India. The goal was to uncover trends, patterns, and key insights using Python, Pandas, and visualization libraries.

## 📘 Project Overview

The project focuses on analyzing vaccination trends across different weekdays and vaccine types in India. It aims to answer questions such as:

- **Which day of the week has the highest vaccination turnout?**
- **Which vaccines are used the most, and why are some underutilized?**

### 🔍 Key Insights

- 📅 **Monday** sees the **highest number of vaccinations**, while **Thursday** is the lowest.
- 💉 **Covaxin** and **Covishield** are the dominant vaccines in use.
- 🧪 **Sputnik** and **AEFI** have extremely limited distribution.
